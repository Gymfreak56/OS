## Recomended commands
```

Identify Rogue Processes: slist vs. psscan; output results to a dot file to have a nice visual representation of parent/child process relationships

Process validity - look for things that are off (misspellings, high PIDs, multiples that shouldnâ€™t be, etc.)

DLLs and Handles: dlllist, dlldump

Network Artifacts: connections

Hunt for Code Injection: malfind

Check for rootkit: psscan, devicetree

Dump suspicious processes and drivers: dlldump, procdump, memdump, filescan, svcscan, driverirp
